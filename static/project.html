			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Initially, I was not responsible for creating digital signages for the whole institute. I was originally in charge of designing graphic profiles for a lab consisting of 5-10 members. The marketing and outreach leaders at the Ellison Institute liked the designs I created for the lab and gave me the opportunity to work on a bigger project for the whole institute.</p>
